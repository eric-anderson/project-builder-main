# Setup ~/.pbrc:
pbconfurl Lintel = file://home/anderse/.git/eric-lintel-pb-conf
pbdefdir default = $ENV{HOME}/cache-project-builder
vmpath default = $ENV{HOME}/cache-project-builder/qemu
vepath default = $ENV{HOME}/cache-project-builder/chroot

# initialize the project; the second lintel controls a name inside the ~pbdefdir/lintel directory
# expect lots of errors from your vcs
pb -p Lintel -r 0.2012.02.28 newproj Lintel

edit .../Lintel.pb
changes in 781b5c0
Create an origin remote and push to there.
% pb -p Lintel -r 0.2012.02.28 cms2build
# switch to centos-5 for vmlist, example uses rpm/mandriva.
# vmlist is irrelevant, the build2pkg command builds for your running OS.
# Lots of fiddling to get next bit to work.
% pb -p Lintel -r 0.2012.02.28 build2pkg

------
pb -v -p Lintel -m debian-6.0-i386 newve

update /etc/wgetrc to specify proxy
add rbsmirrorsrv to ~/.pbrc


Tried -k to keep around the pbscript.### file in the chroot, but that didn't seem to work.
